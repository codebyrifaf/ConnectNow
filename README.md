## Troubleshooting

### Camera Button Not Visible
If you don't see the camera button in the chat:
1. **Restart the app completely** - Close and reopen the app
2. **Clear Metro cache:** `npm start -- --clear`
3. **Rebuild the app:** Stop the development server and run `npm start` again
4. **Check permissions:** Ensure camera/gallery permissions are granted

### Authentication Issues
- Make sure you're entering a unique username during signup
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Try signing out and signing back in

### App Won't Start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear npm cache: `npm start -- --clear`
- Check Node.js version compatibility with Expo

### Database Issues
- The app automatically creates tables on first run
- If experiencing data issues, uninstall and reinstall the app
- Check console for any SQLite error messages

### Photo Sharing Problems
- Grant camera and gallery permissions when prompted
- Ensure device has sufficient storage space
- Try taking a photo instead of selecting from gallery (or vice versa)
